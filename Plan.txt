	•	Keep the repo organized and easy to navigate for grading.

Needs
	•	A public GitHub repo with a clear structure.
	•	Files required for the assignment: QMD, PDF, README, and this plan.
	•	At least one additional branch and two GitHub Issues.

Steps
	1.	Create the repository and add a README.
	2.	Make a second branch (ex: dev or updates) for edits.
	3.	Open GitHub Issues to track tasks (ex: upload files, write README).
	4.	Upload QMD and PDF from Activity #14.  ￼
	5.	Commit and push changes, then open a pull request to merge updates into the main branch.
	6.	Add this plan document as a separate file.
	7.	Keep the repo organized by placing supporting files (QMD, PDF) in a logical folder such as /docs/.
