This repository was created for Activity #14, where I put into practice GitHub fundamentals including version control, branching, issues, commits, pull requests, and project documentation.
This repo contains all required files and demonstrates proper Git/GitHub workflows as outlined in the activity instructions.
This repository includes:	
•Branches
•GitHub Issues documenting tasks or bugs 
•Commit history and pull requests showing proper version control practice	
•README.md
•A plan document explaining how I created/maintain the repo and how I completed Activity #14 
•PDF submitted for Activity #14
•QMD file used in Activity #14

The goals of this repository are:
	•	Create and managing a GitHub repository
	•	Use branches to organize and separate work
	•	Write meaningful commits
	•	Submit pull requests with proper review workflow
	•	Manage tasks through GitHub Issues
	•	Maintain clear project documentation

The current plan is to maintain my documentation as project updates take place and to continue practicing Git and GitHub workflows on future coursework and projects.
